  Here is a bit about my family. My family is a little larger than most families because there is well nine of us. Yes, I have six siblings. Here is something about each one of my family members. My mom has mainly been a stay at home mom, but now that all of her kids are older she is teaching at Perimeter. My mom loves the beach as well as hippos and anything Disney. My dad is a teacher at Johns Creek High School. And he met my mom at Wofford College which is how this family got started. What he teaches is biology and environmental science. So me and my sibs kinda sort of have our own private tutor. My oldest brother, Johnny, is a graduate from Georgia Tech (Go Jackets!). He is 23 and is really into music. My second oldest brother, Micah, just recently graduated from Johns Creek High School starting his journey of college. He is 19 and loves basketball and plans to play in college. I am a rising junior of Johns Creek high school (Go Glads!) I am 16 and fun facts about me are found in the fun facts section. My oldest younger sister, Jael, is a rising freshman beginning the crazy life of high school. She is 14 and is the funniest in the family. My youngest brother, Titus, is now a teenager and will be going to middle school for the first time at Perimeter. He is 13 and is very active always trying new crazy things like flips, nija courses, etc. My second to youngest sister, Sadie, will also be going to Perimeter. She is now 8 and is also physically active like Titus. And my littlest sister, Maddie, is going to kindergarten. She is 4 and everyone addores her.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
  One of my most time-consuming hobbies is basketball. I love basketball. I have been playing for as long as I can remember and hope to keep playing it. I have played on multiple teams due to be homeschooled so there was no designated school to play at. At first I played a couple years in my churche's program. Then I played at Duluth. After that I started playing on the feeder team for John's Creek high school. And now I play at my highschool. The main reason I got into it was because of my dad. My dad was always into sports but played basketball in college. Therefore, if you were a Chadwick child you had to at least try basketball. Which I did and stuck with.

  Another hobby of mine is art. Art is so much fun and a great way to express myself. My favorite form of art is sketching mainly because I have the most control over a pencil rather than a paintbrush. Despite this fact I still very much enjoy painting. Most of my best pieces of art I give away as a gift or a card.

  I love movies, specifically action movies. My favorite series is most definitely Marvel movies. I have been told that I am a nerd when it comes to Marvel.

  </p>
  School wise my favorite subject is math. I wouldn't say I love math, but it can be enjoyable when I get the hang of it. I also love Disney. I have only been to Disney World once with most of my family. We hope to go again with the whole family. I also like fashion and like to say that I am a relatively organized person.
